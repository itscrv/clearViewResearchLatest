We have all witnessed the impact of good <br /> decisions, as well as, the impact of bad decisions being made in our personal <br /> and professional lives. Without a ClearView on things we know how easy it <br /> can be to make a poor decision. Poor decisions can be costly and sometimes  <br /> the damage can be irreversible. We exist to serve decision-makers in <br /> businesses, lifestyle brands, charities and governments (who seek to be <br /> game-changers and make an impact) to access unique and trustworthy <br /> audience insights, to make not good but great decisions that solve their <br /> complex problems (and benefit society at large). <br />
                                <br> With our multidisciplinary and experienced team, we have a unique ability to <br /> engage and gather consumer insight from various audiences such as: <br /> children, Generation Z, millennials, under-represented groups (e.g. people <br /> from Black, Asian or other ethnic minority groups) and vulnerable groups.<br /> <br> We have worked on projects across 4 continents and most recently, in <br /> countries such as Australia, Brazil and Spain. We have worked on project <br /> briefs for the likes of Starbucks UK, NHS England, the Vodafone Foundation, <br /> Unicef UK, Tinder and so on.</p>

                                          Our values and social impact <br><br> Company values <br><br>  Advancing knowledge: We are committed to learning and advancing existing knowledge in our fields of interest. As there is no point wasting resources on doing research that does not advance knowledge.<br /><br> Authenticity: We believe that being true to ourselves and keeping true to our values is key for us as an organisation. We want to maintain a reputation as an ethical organisation, who are what they say they are on the tin. <br /><br> Bold: We do not hesitate to explore uncomfortable social issues or business challenges that our clients face. We always want to out-do ourselves and aim for the stars with all our projects outcomes and deliverables. <br /><br> Co-production: We believe that collaboration is key and can produce even better results. So when possible we co-produce our work and reports in collaboration with our clients or other organisations. <br /><br> Exceptional: We pride ourselves in being exceptional in everything we do. We will go over and beyond to ensure that we are distinctively different from, and better than others who are offering the same services that we provide. We hold ourselves and our work to a high standard. <br /><br> Following best practice: We are accountable to upholding best-practice and leading by example. We will follow best-practice as well as develop best-practice.<br /><br>  Inclusive: We believe that working with a multicultural and multidisciplinary team of various religious faiths, beliefs, gender, age, sexuality  or disability can only be a benefit to our organisation and our work. <br /><br> Integrity: We believe that our integrity is everything. Everything we do is with honour. We will not accept bribes or collude in any corruption. We follow the laws and rules we are bound by and do not engage in any activity to sidestep them. We want to be the most-trusted insight and strategy agency not just the fastest growing. We pride ourselves on consistently being a company providing valuable insights that our clients can trust. We are a profit making business accountable to our shareholders. However, our ultimate accountability is in the best interest of society. We will therefore uphold this value, even at the detriment of losing business. <br /><br> Our greatest asset is our team: Our team is our greatest asset. Therefore, we put our team’s welfare first. We maintain the ethos of people over profit. Members of our team are regularly offered training for their personal and professional development. Our team at work, is our extended family away from home, and we look after each other. <br /><br> Reliable: We are a reliable team that we can be depended on to deliver what is required of us by our clients. We strive to provide our clients with research that is robust, sound and can withstand scrutiny. We understand that we have a responsibility to undertake research that is both credible, accurate and reliable that informs important decision-making. <br /><br> Simple language: We dislike jargon and the use of big words for no reason. We adopt the ‘grandma test’ and ‘speaking to a 7 year old test,’ when writing up our research and communicating with ourselves, clients and external audience. So, if we couldn’t explain it to our grandma or a 7 year old, then we know that we have not simplified our language enough. <br /><br> Social Impact: We exist to make an impact on society and help to create a world where better decisions are made (based on trusted and valuable insights) that benefit society at large. Outside of client work, all the team work 1 day a month pro-bono for our supporting charities or causes they are passionate about. <br /><br> Teamwork Makes The Dream Work: We believe that a diverse group of committed and smart-working people working together in harmony, can achieve exceptional results. <br /><br> Everyone in the team is an asset and essential to us achieving success Unconventional: We challenge ourselves to think outside the box (and as if there is no box), in order to be innovative and provide our clients with unique, game-changing solutions and services. We do not adopt a 9-5 working policy. Focus is placed on task completion not on how many hours spent sitting on a chair in the office. This means that our team can work flexible hours and just have to complete tasks by the task deadline (but to an exceptional standard). <br /><br> “We take our work seriously but not ourselves”: Our founders are strong believers in work-life integration and their ethos is that as a business “we take our work seriously but not ourselves.” Yes, we all want to help solve our clients challenges, change the world, and have a social impact but it does not mean we can’t have fun and live a fulfilling life in the process. <br /><br> Social Impact Statement <br /><br> As a business we are committed to making a social impact and also putting our money, time and resources where our mouth is. All our staff volunteer at least 1 day a month of research support and consultancy to a charitable organisation or social cause. <br /><br> So far the charities we have directly supported are:<br /><br>  ● Amos Bursary <br> ● City Gateway <br> ● ¬¬ <br>  ● Advocacy Academy<br> ● MoorEmpowerment <br><br> So far we have collaborated on pro-bono projects with: <br><br> ● The Social Impact Consultancy - to develop a social impact framework for charitable organisations <br> ● I Want To Level Up - to support the development of the Character Builders leadership programme <br><br> So far we have donated to several causes, including the following charities: <br><br> ● 2020 Change <br> ● Strength With In Me (SWIM)
